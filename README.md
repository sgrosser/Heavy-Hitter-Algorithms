# Heavy-Hitter-Algorithms
Written for CS 590D (Algorithms for Data Science) PSet 2. Uses https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall15/compsci590.4/assignment2/tweetstream.zip

## Explanation
We have both the k-majority algorithm and a Count-Min Sketch implemented in the Heavy Hitters class. 

NOTE: I only parsed the first hash tag out of each tweet since I could not find how to parse multiple hash tags. Everything is implemented correctly, but the results will be different due to a different set of hashtags.
